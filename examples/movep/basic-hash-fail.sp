# BASIC HASH

The Basic Hash protocol as described in [A] is an RFID protocol involving:

* a tag associated to a secret key;
* generic readers having access to a database containing all these keys.

The protocol is as follows:

```
T --> R : <nT, h(nT,key)>
R --> T : ok
```

This file shows an incorrect attempt at proving unlinkability for Basic
Hash. Unlinkability fails for the proposed system, for an irrelevant
reason.

    For single-session version we need to find `k` in addition
    to `i`. *)

(** Prove `wa_R` as in `basic-hash-wa.sp` slightly modified to also
    hold for single-session system.
    The statement (or rather, its projections) is proved for both
    the left and right projections of the `BasicHash` system. *)
lemma [BasicHash] wa_R :
  forall (tau:timestamp),
    happens(tau) =>
    ((exists (i,k:index),
       snd(input@tau) = h(fst(input@tau),diff(key(i),key'(i,k))))
     <=>
     (exists (i,k:index), T(i,k) < tau &&
       fst(output@T(i,k)) = fst(input@tau) &&
       snd(output@T(i,k)) = snd(input@tau))).
(** The high-level idea of the proof is to use the EUF cryptographic axiom:
    only the tag `T(i,k)` can forge `h(nT(i,k),key(i))` because the secret key
    is not known by the attacker.
    Therefore, any message accepted by the reader must come from a tag that has
    played before.
    The converse implication is trivial because any honest tag output is
    accepted by the reader. *)

       be obtained from the hypotheses.*)

Qed.

(** There is no hope to prove unlinkability, i.e. the observational equivalence
    of the multiple- and single-session systems.
    Why? *)
