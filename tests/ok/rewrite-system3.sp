(* test the interaction of rewriting and systems:
   conditions under which the rewriting can occur must be correctly 
   projected. *)

system a = null.

axiom [a] ax (tau:timestamp) : diff(tau = init,False) => input@tau = diff(c,d).

axiom [any] refl (x:message) : x = x.

lemma [a/left] _ (tau:timestamp) : tau = init => input@tau = c.
Proof.
