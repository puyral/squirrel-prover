# Squirrel Prover

## Try it

Online version of `Squirrel` is available with a complete tutorial
[here](https://squirrel-prover.github.io/jsquirrel/?open=0-logic.sp).

You can find more examples in the `examples` directory.

## Reference Manual

The manual is available online
[here](https://squirrel-prover.github.io/documentation/).

For more information, the presentation site is on
[github.io](https://squirrel-prover.github.io/).

## Build

You need OCaml version 4.10 or more (tested up to 4.13.1).

We recommend that you use opam (version 2.0 or more). It will notably allow
you to install the required tools and libraries, with the following command
inside this directory:
```
$ opam install . -y --deps-only
```

You should then be able to build the software. The default target
builds the prover and testing binaries and runs tests:
```
$ make
```

You can also just build the prover with `make squirrel`, test with `make test`.

The documentation for developers may be built with `make doc`.

The documentation for users may be built with `make refman-html`.

### Installing the Proof General mode for Emacs (optional, recommended)

The required `.el` files are inside the `utils` folder. 
We recommend installing Proof General from the git repository.


- Clone the git repository of proof general inside your `~/.emacs.d/lisp`:
```
mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/lisp/ && cd ~/.emacs.d/lisp/
git clone https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG
```

- Create a squirrel sub-directory:
```
mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG/squirrel
```

- Copy and paste this file, and `squirrel-syntax.el` inside it (creating
  symbolic links may be a better idea if you intend your config to follow
  the repository changes):
```
cp squirrel.el squirrel-syntax.el ~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG/squirrel
```

- Moreover, in the file `~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG/generic/proof-site.el`,
   add to the list `proof-assistant-table-default` the following line:
```
 (squirrel "Squirrel" "sp")
```
Then erase the outdated compiled version of this file:
```
rm ~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG/generic/proof-site.elc
```

- Run the following command to configure emacs:
```
echo -e "(require 'ansi-color)\n(load \"~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG/generic/proof-site\")" >> ~/.emacs
```

- Run emacs from the squirrel repository on some example file,
with the squirrel repository in the path:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/squirrel
emacs examples/<file>.sp
```

### Unicode support in Emacs (Proof General) (optional)

If you are missing some Unicode fonts in Emacs, you can try installing the Symbola font.
For example, on a Debian distribution:
```
 apt-get install -y fonts-symbola 
```
should do the trick.

### Dependencies for the `smt` tactic (optional)

(If those dependencies are not installed, Squirrel will still compile, but the
`smt` tactic won't work. You will need to recompile Squirrel *after* the `why3`
package has been installed.)

First install Why3 and Alt-Ergo using opam:
```
$ opam install why3 alt-ergo
```

This also installs the Why3 OCaml library used by Squirrel.

Then tell Why3 to automatically detect that Alt-Ergo is installed and update its
configuration accordingly:
```
$ why3 config detect
```

Why3 is also able to find SMT solvers installed using the system package manager
(e.g. `sudo dnf install z3` on Fedora) but those aren't supported by our code
yet.

## Use

### Standalone

You can check a proof development by simply passing the file to `squirrel`:
```
$ ./squirrel examples/basic-hash.sp
```
or using Emacs with the Proof General mode (if installed)
```
$ emacs examples/basic-hash.sp
```

### Data visualisation (with Proof General)

To have a graphical representation of the state of the proof,
set the variable `SP_VISU` to `ok` in your environnement.
Then, launch a Squirrel file with Emacs:

```
$ export SP_VISU=ok
$ emacs examples/basic-hash.sp
```

You need to validate at least one line in Emacs to launch the local server.
Then, you can access the visualisation at: [http://localhost:8080/visualisation.html](http://localhost:8080/visualisation.html)

### Export in HTML format (needs [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

To convert a Squirrel development to HTML, you need:

* A **Squirrel file** `PATH1/squirrel_name.sp`
* An **HTML template file** `PATH2/page.html` containing a line:
`<!--HERE-->` (without spaces or tabulations)

A default HTML template can be found at `scripts/html_export/page.html`.


```
./squirrel PATH1/squirrel_name.sp --html PATH2/page.html
```

The previous command will create a copy of `page.html` in the same directory pointed
by `PATH1` named `squirrel_name.html`. **Beware** that, if a file already
exists with this name, it will be deleted by this operation.

This new file will have the output of Squirrel formatted in HTML and placed
where the `<!--HERE-->` tag is.

Squirrel will put its results between span tags that will not be displayed. This result can later be processed, with javascript for example.

Each instruction in the Squirrel file is translated into an item
of the following form (with `_i` in the tags' id replaced by the number of the instuction):

```
<span class="squirrel-step" id="step_i">
  <span class="input-line" id="in_i">
    Input
  </span>
  <span class="output-line" id="out_i">
    Output
  </span>
  <span class="com-line" id="com_i">
    Comment
  </span>
</span>
```

The "Comment" part will be filled by comments in the Squirrel file starting with `(**` and ending with `*)`.
It is possible to format these comment with pandoc's Markdown (detailled [here](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown)).
Others comments will be left in the "Input" part.
















## Examples
Examples of developments in Squirrel can be found in:
- `examples/`

Those include classical and post-quantum sound proofs of protocols.
See `examples/README.md` for details.

## Tutorial

For a first introduction to the syntax, we recommend to open with ProofGeneral
the `examples/basic-tutorial/tutorial.sp`, that provides a run through of the syntax
with executables snippets. Then, browsing the `examples` folder should provide a
wide variety of examples, starting e.g. with `basic-hash.sp`.

### Detailed Tutorial

A more complete tutorial is available in
```
examples/tutorial/
```

This tutorial consists in a series of exercises of increasing
difficulty, and covers the basic logical constructs and tactics
manipulating them, several cryptographic assumptions, accessibility
properties (authentication, injective authentication), equivalence
properties (unlinkability), stateful protocol, and protocol
composition.

## Quick syntax guide

Squirrel developments are conventionally written in `.sp` files. They start
with a system description, followed by some lemmas corresponding to trace
properties.

Comments are noted `(* in this way *)`.

### System description

#### Messages

Terms can be of type `message`, `boolean`, `index` and `timestamp`.
The first two are message kinds, respectively corresponding to a bitstring
of length the security parameter, and a single bit. Indices are used to
have infinite collections of objects, and timestamps are used in the
meta-logic.

You can declare new term constructors, with identifier `id`,
of the following kinds, where `msg_type` is either `message` or
`boolean`, and `args` is a comma-separated list of typed variables,
e.g. `x:boolean` or `i:index`:
```
hash <id>                                          (* keyed hash function *)
name <id> : index -> .. -> index -> message        (* indexed name *)
mutable <id> : index -> .. -> index -> <msg_type>  (* indexed memory cell *)
```

Declarations blocks are delimited with a `.`, which defines the next bunch of
code that will be processed by Squirrel.

#### Processes

Processes are then declared as follows, using previously declared channels:
```
channel <id>
process <id>(<args>) = <process>
```
The syntax of processes is similar to the one used in ProVerif. New
names can be introduced inside processes: they will be transformed into
toplevel declarations (indexed as necessary) when the model is ingested
by the prover. Replications are indexed, written `!_i <process>`, to
be able to refer to their copies.

#### System

Finally, the system under study is declared:
```
system <process>.
```

The system can be given an explicit name using the following syntax,
which is necessary when multiple systems are used in the same file:
```
system [NAME] <process>.
```

### Axioms, lemmas and proofs

Axioms can be declared using the "axiom" keyword:
```
axiom NAME : <formula>.
```
Note that an axiom can only be declared after the corresponding system
has been declared.

Axioms can be declared for a specific system, rather than the default
one:
```
axiom [SYSTEM_NAME] GOAL_NAME : <formula>.
```

Reachability goals are noted as follows:
```
goal NAME : <formula>.
```

By default, a goal is expressed simultaneously for the two projections
of the system. In such cases, it is often the case that, at some point
in the proof, one needs to use the `project` tactic to handle separately
the two sides.

Alternatively, goals can be stated wrt a specific side of the system:
```
goal [left/right/none,SYSTEM_NAME] GOAL_NAME : <formula>.
```

Goals are proved using tactic-based proof scripts. Proofs start with
`Proof` and end with `Qed`. The special tactic `help` can be used to
obtain a list of all available tactics (for reachability or equivalence
goals, depending on the context).
